# ðŸ©» AI-Powered Chest X-ray Diagnosis with ResNet-50 and Grad-CAM

This project builds an AI-based medical diagnosis tool that uses **ResNet-50** to classify chest X-ray images and applies **Grad-CAM** for visual interpretability. It is built using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset and focuses on detecting pneumonia (or binary classification tasks).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Trained CNN model (ResNet-50) on labeled chest X-ray images
- âœ… Grad-CAM visualization for medical explainability
- âœ… Data preprocessing and augmentation
- âœ… Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)
- âœ… Modular and easy-to-extend codebase

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Base model: `ResNet-50` (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Final layer modified for binary classification (`Normal` vs `Pneumonia`)
- Loss Function: `CrossEntropyLoss`
- Optimizer: `Adam`

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
We used the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset for training and evaluation.
Due to its size and license restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.
