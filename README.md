# AI-Powered Chest X-ray Diagnosis with ResNet-50 and Grad-CAM

This project builds an AI-based medical diagnosis web application that uses a **ResNet-50** convolutional neural network to classify chest X-ray images into **Normal** or **Pneumonia** categories. The predictions are visually explained using **Grad-CAM**, highlighting regions that contributed most to the model’s decision.

The system includes a complete pipeline — from training on Kaggle to local web deployment using Flask.
